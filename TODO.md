# ToDo

* Make interface selection permanent, currently after every reboot you have to reselect interface in replicant context menu.
* Make middle click on replicant open the Statistics window.
* Gradually switch to KiB/MiB/GiB and switch back (and forth) to bytes on mouse click
* Network mask, gateway and dns servers should also be shown
* The Connect menu option doesn't fully bring back the interface, for example I have to manually issue ifconfig /dev/net/ipro1000/0 auto-config after I use Disconnect/Connect
